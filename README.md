There are two files in this directory:
1. "Earthquake_features.csv" contains features derived from raw data of laboratory earthquake experiment. Raw data are available here:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction/data

2. "Earthquake_code.ipynb" contains Python code in Jupyter Notebook format. The code reproduces results of modelling presented in Table 1. All necessary comments are placed in the code. 

Place both files in the same directory for proper working. Open "Earthquake_code.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook and run the cell with code.
